#Exercise 1: Pascal’s Triangle
#####The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal’s triangle.
<pre>
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
   ... </pre>
#####The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a function that computes the elements of Pascal’s triangle by means of a recursive process.
- Do this exercise by implementing the pascal function in Main.scala, which takes a column c and a row r, counting from 0 and returns the number at that spot in the triangle. For example, pascal(0,2)=1,pascal(1,2)=2 and pascal(1,3)=3.

#Exercise 2: Parentheses Balancing

#####Write a recursive function which verifies the balancing of parentheses in a string, which we represent as a List[Char] not a String. For example, the function should return true for the following strings:

- (if (zero? x) max (/ 1 x))
- I told him (that it’s not (yet) done). (But he wasn’t listening)
#####The function should return false for the following strings:

- :-)
- ())(
The last example shows that it’s not enough to verify that a string contains the same number of opening and closing parentheses.

Do this exercise by implementing the balance function in Main.scala.

#Exercise 3: Counting Change

#####Write a recursive function that counts how many different ways you can make change for an amount, given a list of coin denominations. For example, there are 3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomination 1 and 2: 1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 2+2.

#####Do this exercise by implementing the countChange function inMain.scala. This function takes an amount to change, and a list of unique denominations for the coins.
